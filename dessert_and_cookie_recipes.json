Toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, tossing them until evenly browned, or in the oven for 8-10 minutes - keep an eye on them as they burn easily. When they are cool, chop roughly. Stir the eggs, nuts and ground almonds into the fruit mixture and mix well. Sift the flour, baking powder and spices into the pan. Stir in gently, until there are no traces of flour left.",
      "Spoon the mixture into the tin and smooth it down evenly - you will find this is easiest with the back of a metal spoon which has been dipped into boiling water.",
      "Bake for 45 minutes, then turn down the heat to 140C/gas 1/ fan120C and cook for a further 1-1\u00bc hours (about a further 1\u00be hours if you have a gas oven) until the cake is dark golden in appearance and firm to the touch. Cover the top of the cake with foil if it starts to darken too much. To check the cake is done, insert a fine skewer into the centre - if it comes out clean, the cake is cooked.",
      "Make holes all over the warm cake with a fine skewer and spoon the extra 4tbsp brandy over the holes until it has all soaked in. Leave the cake to cool in the tin. When it's cold, remove it from the tin, peel off the lining paper, then wrap first in baking parchment and then in foil. The cake will keep in a cupboard for up to three months or you can freeze it for six months."

      "The night before making the cake, put the mixed fruit and cherries in a bowl, add your chosen spirit or orange juice, cover with cling film and leave to soak for 8-12 hrs. If you don\u2019t have time to soak the fruit, put the bowl in the microwave for 5 mins, stir, then microwave for 5 mins more before leaving to cool completely.",
      "Grease a 23cm springform cake tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment. Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 3. Using a large bowl and electric hand whisk, or a stand-alone mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until pale, light and fluffy. Spoon in the golden syrup, then add the beaten egg in 4 additions, whisking well after each and adding 1 tbsp of the flour to prevent the mixture from curdling. When all the eggs have been incorporated, gently fold in the rest of the flour and the spices. Finally, fold in the soaked fruit and the orange and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top with the back of the spoon. Bake for 2 hrs or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Your kitchen will be filled with lovely Christmas smells!",
      "Leave the cake to cool in the tin for about 30 mins. Remove from the tin and place on a wire rack until completely cold. If not decorating straight away, wrap the cake in foil to store. If you\u2019ve made your cake a few weeks before you want to eat it, you can brush the cake with a little extra alcohol every week for up to 4 weeks. This will keep it moist and add flavour.",
      "To decorate the cake, brush all over with a little melted jam. Lightly dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll out the marzipan to a circle, large enough to cover the top and sides of the cake. Lift the marzipan by hanging it over the rolling pin and drape it over the cake. Smooth the marzipan down the sides of the cake, then trim away any excess from the bottom. Brush the marzipan all over with the remaining apricot jam, then roll out 1kg of the fondant icing and, using the same method as for the marzipan, cover your cake with the icing. Trim the edges and smooth out any marks with the palm of your hand, rubbing the icing to give it a shine.",
      "Knead the remaining icing, then cut off a small piece, about the size of a small marble, and set aside. Colour the large piece of icing with brown food colouring, adding a little at a time and kneading in well, until you have the desired colour. Divide the icing into 3, then shape a reindeer \u2013 body, head, 2 feet and a tail \u2013 from each piece. Mix 1 tbsp icing sugar with a tiny splash of water to use as a glue. Stick the head onto the body and squash down a little. Use a small knife to make three indents in the feet, then stick to the reindeer body, along with the tail.",
      "Remove a small piece from the reserved icing to make Rudolph\u2019s red nose. Colour with red food colouring, then use the icing glue to attach to one of the reindeer heads. Colour the remaining icing black and shape into two more noses and two eyes for each reindeer, then stick onto the heads. Poke half a pretzel into either side of the reindeers\u2019 heads to create antlers. Use a little of the icing sugar glue to stick the reindeer to the top of the cake, then tie the gold string around their bodies to create reins. Finish the cake by tying a sparkling red ribbon around the base and securing it in place with a pin."

Meanwhile, generously grease the wells of a 12-hole friand tin (we used a Master Class non-stick friand tin, or you can use a deep non-stick muffin tin). Sift the dry ingredients for the friands, including the remaining ground cardamom, into a large bowl. Also add the rougher bits of almond that collect in the sieve.",

Divide the batter between the tin and top with the crumble, then poke in the apple slices. Bake for 25 mins or until golden and risen. I find it best to let the friands cool in the tin, then carefully ease them out with a palette knife. Best on the day they are made, but will keep in an airtight tin for 2 days, or freeze for 1 month."

Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until lightly coloured. Cool slightly, then tip half the almonds and half the pistachios into the food processer and grind to a fine powder. Roughly chop the remaining almonds (keep the pistachios whole).",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool. Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Grease and double-line the base and sides of a 20cm-deep cake tin with baking parchment.",
      "Stir the chopped and ground nuts and the eggs into the cooled mixture. Set a sieve over the pan and sift in the flour, baking powder and spices. Stir in gently until the flour is well mixed in. Stir in the orange flower water.",
      "Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top. Bake for 2 hrs, then reduce the heat to 140C/120C fan/gas 1 and cook for a further 1-1\u00bd hrs until the cake is dark golden and firm to touch. If the cake starts to become too dark, place 2 sheets of foil loosely on top.",
      "To test it is cooked through, insert a fine skewer into the centre \u2013 if it comes out clean with no uncooked cake stuck to the skewer, it is cooked. If not, cook for a further 15 mins and test again.",
      "Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 30 mins, then turn out, peel off the paper and cool on a wire rack. Wrap in 2 sheets of baking parchment, then overwrap in foil. Will keep for 3 months, or freeze for up to a year.",
      "To make the pistachio paste, grind the nuts as finely as possible in a blender or food processor. Tip into a bowl with the sugars and ground almonds. Add a few drops of almond extract, the egg yolks and lemon juice, and mix to a firm dough, using your hands to work the mixture into a ball.",
      "Knead the dough to a fairly smooth ball, then cut off a third and wrap in cling film. Dust the work surface with a little icing sugar and roll out the remaining paste to a little larger than the top of the cake. Brush the cake thinly with apricot jam and cover with the paste. Trim off excess using a sharp knife in a downward movement around the side of the cake.",
      "Add a few drops of green food colour to the remaining pistachio paste to make it green. To make a tree, pinch off a small piece of paste and flatten between your fingers to a rough round. Place on a tray dusted with icing sugar. Make a smaller round and place on top, slightly offcentre. Continue to build up the tree, then top with a tiny paste cone. Repeat to make 7 trees in varying sizes. Leave to dry for several hours or overnight in a cool dry place. To make the icing, beat the egg whites with the lemon juice and glucose in a mixing bowl. Gradually sift in the icing sugar, beating all the time to make a stiff icing that forms peaks.",
      "Tie the ribbon round the cake. Thread a cocktail stick through a tree base, then thread on the tree, leaving a little of the stick showing at the base to attach to the cake. Swirl the icing thickly over the cake, forming peaks and teasing it over the sides. Stick the trees into the top of the cake and scatter over a handful of silver balls. Dust the trees thickly with icing sugar."

Meanwhile, line a 1.2-litre pudding basin with cling film.",

      "Splash in brandy, add cranberries and boil gently till the cranberries pop, but still hold their shape and colour the sauce. If you want to, sieve the seeds out of the sauce and add some more cranberries for a really glossy finish. Serve hot or warm."

Let's say that it's UNEATABLE, because of the baking soda it's sour and when you take a bite (I made a few gingerbread men extra), this sour taste stays in your mouth for some time and when you burp (just needed to be honest to the bone), it's horrible!

I added a touch more Greek yoghurt than stated to combat dryness. I also forgot to add the flaked almonds to the mixture so added them to the top. They had rave reviews from friends and my husband (who doesn't do dried fruits, nuts or marzipan!) liked the texture. Will be making again, probably in a few days time.

Use a paintbrush to moisten the underside of each leaf with a little water \u2013 don\u2019t make them too wet though, or the green colour might leak onto the rest of the cake.

      "Roll the dough into a square, roughly 40 x 40cm, then cut into 3 long strips. Break the marzipan into 3 balls, then roll each to the same length as the strips of dough. Put 1 marzipan sausage on top of each strip of dough, then pinch the sides of the dough together to encase the marzipan \u2013 so you have 3 long sausages of marzipan-filled dough. Flip the dough over so the seams are underneath, then pinch the 3 ends together. Tightly plait the dough, pinching together to seal when you finish. Place the plait on a baking tray lined with baking parchment, tucking the ends under for a neat finish. Cover loosely with a sheet of oiled cling film, leave to prove for 30 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size.",
      "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Uncover the plait, brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle over the almonds. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 30 mins until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and dust with icing sugar before serving. Will keep for up to 5 days in a sealed container."

      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and boil the kettle. First, make the chocolate cake. Liberally grease the bundt tin with butter, then dust with flour and shake out the excess. Put the cocoa in a bowl with a pinch of salt, cover with 150ml hot water from the kettle, mix until smooth, then set aside to cool. Put the butter and sugar in a bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Sift in the flour and baking powder and fold everything together. Stir the soured cream into the cocoa mixture, then add to the other bowl and mix until just combined, then scrape into the prepared tin. Bake for 35 mins until a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool for 15 mins in the tin, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "When the cake is cool, transfer to a baking sheet lined with baking parchment, and make space for the cake and tray in your freezer. Slice the cake into pieces roughly the thickness of your star cutter, then pull each piece out a little, so there is space around each one. Pop the cake in the freezer for 2 hrs, or overnight.",
      "When the cake is firmly frozen, lay each slice on its side, keeping them in the same circular pattern, and cut out a star, using the cutter, from the middle of each piece. Leftover cake can be kept in the freezer for up to 2 months, ready for making a trifle. Return the cut-out stars to the freezer.",
      "Now, make the peppermint cake. Grease the same bundt tin and heat your oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the butter and sugar in a bowl and beat until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each, then add the flour, soured cream and peppermint extract. Give everything a good mix and scrape half the mixture into the bundt tin. Remove the stars from the freezer and line up in a circle on top of the cake mixture (pointy sides up) \u2013 make sure there are no gaps and that the stars perfectly line up. Spoon the remaining cake mixture on top, easing it around the stars until they are just covered. Bake for 45 mins until risen and golden brown and a skewer poked into the side of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "For the icing, melt the chocolate in short blasts in the microwave, or in a bowl suspended over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring it occasionally. Set aside to cool a little. In a large bowl, beat the icing sugar and butter until pale and smooth. Add the chocolate and peppermint extract, and mix again until combined. When the cake is completely cool, place on a serving plate, then swirl over the chocolate icing, easing it about halfway down the sides to create a snowy effect. Place the Maltesers on top of the cake. Will keep for up to 3 days in a sealed container."

      "First, make the sponge. Put the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and whisk with an electric whisk until thick and creamy. Sift the cocoa powder over the egg mixture and whisk in thoroughly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold a third of the egg whites into the cocoa mixture, then gently fold in the rest until evenly distributed.",
      "Pour into the prepared tin and spread gently with a spatula. Bake in the centre of the oven for 25 mins or until well risen and just beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tin. Remove from the oven, loosen the edges with a round-bladed knife and leave to cool in the tin.",
      "Prepare the filling while the cake is cooling. Place a large sheet of cling film on the work surface, take the ice cream out of its tub and place on top. Working quickly, cover the ice cream with cling film, then press and roll into a long sausage shape. It will need to be 33cm long and around 5cm wide. Wrap a second piece of cling film around the first and twist the ends to maintain the sausage shape. Return to the freezer to harden for at least 1 hr.",
      "Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Take the ice cream out of the freezer, unwrap it and place in the centre of the sponge. Using the parchment to help you, bring up the sides to enclose the ice cream and carefully lift the roll onto the lined baking tray, rotating it so the seal is underneath. Trim the ends. Cover the cake and tin with cling film and place in the freezer for at least 4 hrs, or up to 1 week.",
      "Make the meringue topping 20 mins before serving. Put the sugar and 175ml water in a pan and bring to a rolling boil over a high heat. Continue to boil until it reaches 115C on a sugar thermometer.",
      "Meanwhile, put the egg whites in a large mixing bowl or tabletop mixer and whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Continue whisking at high speed and very slowly trickle in the hot sugar syrup. The meringue will begin to thicken and become glossy after about 10 mins. Continue to whisk until it is just warm, then whisk in the vanilla extract. Use the meringue immediately, as it is easier to work with while warm.",
      "Fit a large piping bag with a 1.5cm star nozzle and fill with the meringue. Take the baking tray out of the freezer and slide the log gently onto a serving platter using a couple of spatulas. Pipe the meringue in lines down the length, then around the ends. Use a cook\u2019s blowtorch to scorch the meringue all over. Alternatively, bake for 8 mins at 220C/200C fan/gas 7 or until the meringue is set and lightly browned. Serve in generous slices (it will sit quite happily for 5-10 mins). Please note this recipe contains lightly cooked egg whites, which may be unsuitable for babies and toddlers, the elderly, pregnant women and people who already feel unwell."

    "Description": "These are delicious! Pretty easy to make but just need a bit more preparation . I make mine to the size in the recipe but bake in a deep tray really for muffins. The cakey stollen mixture spreads out and sits neatly atop the mince pie bit which looks good. I have put chopped pistachios on top prior to the bake ... this works well ... or put dried cranberries and/or juicy yellow raisins in the cake mixture as well as marzipan but they will burn if you just put them on top. I have also put lemon zest on top of the blob of mincemeat .. also nice :)",

If you plan to hang the biscuits up, make a small hole in the top of each one using a skewer. Repeat with remaining dough.",

Drizzle the chocolate over the biscuits, or pipe on shapes or names, then stick a few silver balls into the chocolate. If hung up on the tree, the biscuits will be edible for about a week, but will last a lot longer as decorations."

    "Name": "Black Forest trifle",
    "Description": "Very easy, but didn't look it! Perfect pud for volume catering. Having read the comments (thanks everyone - so helpful!), I replaced the choc brownie with choc muffin as I wanted a lighter trifle. Choc custard was delicious. Nearly made an error with the cherries as I couldn't find the version in the recipe so picked up a couple of cans of tinned cherries, pinched one when I opened the tin - heck a stone! Bit daft, but hadn't been expecting that so quickly stoned them - didn't take long. Another time I might must use frozen stoned cherries which I usually have in the house anyway. Made up for the lack of kirsch by putting in some cherry brandy from the drinks cab. Topping was great, and the whole thing looked rather lovely with lots of grated choc on the top. Would definitely do again.",

    "Description": "It looked better than the photo when I made it, but the taste was not as good as expected.\nThe recipe could have been better. It says bake for 10 minutes but it came out a bit too dry. I think 7 minutes would have been better. I saw the winner of the Bake Off Christmas Special do something similar and she baked it for 7 minutes iirc. Also you have to be careful when you whip the double cream because it only takes a few seconds of whipping for it to get too stiff. A warning in the recipe would have been nice for inexperienced bakers like myself.\nThe cream may have benefitted from a little sugar added to it, but I guess that's why they say to add mint to it because something is definitely missing from the cream if you don't add either sugar or mint.\nNext time I will try Delia's recipe as I hear that one is better.",

Put the coconut oil and sugar in a large bowl and use an electric whisk to beat together for about 5 mins until light and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until fully combined before adding more. Working in three additions, add the flour, alternating with the coconut milk, then add the vanilla extract.",
      "Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin tin using an ice cream scoop, then bake for 20-22 mins or until the cakes are golden and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the tin and cool on a wire rack.",
      "The whipped cream is best made within a few hours of serving. Open the can of coconut milk upside down and pour off the thin liquid. Scoop the thick coconut milk into a large bowl, add the icing sugar and the vanilla, and whisk for 2-3 mins until soft and fluffy. Spread or scoop the whipped cream onto the cupcakes and sprinkle with the desiccated coconut. Best stored in the fridge and eaten within a couple of days."

Pour the milk into the flour mix, then stir with a round-bladed knife to make a soft dough, adding a drop more milk if needed to mop up any dry crumbs in the bottom of the bowl. Gather the dough into a ball, then knead for 3-4 mins on a lightly floured surface. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave until the dough has risen to double the size (about 45 mins-1 hr).",

Fold each side into the centre to overlap slightly. Press the edges with the rolling pin to seal, turn the dough, then repeat the rolling out and spreading of the fruit twice more. Roll out to a final rectangle that is 55cm x 16cm. Roll the marzipan into a sausage shape, so it\u2019s slightly shorter than the length of the dough. Place it down the centre. Roll the dough over the marzipan, then turn the dough over so the join is underneath. Lift onto a buttered baking sheet, then curl the dough round a buttered 12cm round cake tin (see tip, below), brushing the ends with a little beaten egg and pinching them well together to seal.",

      "Start with the fruit. Pour the apple juice into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the butter, let it melt, then take off the heat and add the syrup and rum. Put the mixed fruit and cranberries into a large bowl, pour over the hot rum mix, then cover tightly with cling film and leave overnight.",
      "The next day, heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and double-line a 20cm round, deep cake tin with non-stick baking parchment. Beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and pale, then gradually beat in the eggs until light and fluffy. If the mix starts to split or look lumpy, add 1 tbsp of the flour and keep beating. Sift in the flour, spices and 1/4 tsp salt, and fold in using a large spoon. Fold in the orange zest, nuts, soaked fruit and soaking liquid.",
      "Spoon the batter into the tin, level the top, then make a slight dimple in the middle using the back of the spoon. Bake for 1 hr 30 mins, then reduce oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1 and bake for a further 1 hr 45 mins or until it has risen, is a dark golden colour and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Put the tin on a cooling rack and leave until warm.",
      "To feed the cake the first time, use a cocktail stick to poke all over the top of the warm cake. Stir together the rum and maple syrup, then slowly spoon over the cake. Cool completely, then remove the baking parchment, wrap loosely in clean baking parchment and store in an airtight tin. Feed the cake every week to 10 days until you decorate it.",
      "Now you're ready to cover and ice your cake. Sit the cake on a large flat plate or board and brush a thin layer of apricot jam over the top and sides.",
      "Dust the work surface with icing sugar. Lightly knead the marzipan until pliable, then roll out in one direction, turning the marzipan 90 degrees every few rolls and keeping the pressure even. Keep it in a circular shape, reshaping it if needed as you go. When large enough (about 35cm across for a 20cm cake), lift over the cake. Smooth the top and sides with your palms and trim with a knife. If you have time, leave to dry overnight.",
      "Clean the work surface and rolling pin. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the sides with cooled boiled water or alcohol, then cover with the sugarpaste icing, rolling it in the same way. Lift onto the cake, then work your way gradually around, smoothing out any folds with your palms to avoid wrinkles forming. Polish the icing with the palms of your hands (or a proper cake smoother) for a smooth finish. Trim with a sharp knife.",
      "Using the cutters, cut out shapes in the icing, pressing down as far as the marzipan, then removing the middles. To make teardrop and bird shapes, use a small sharp knife to cut points above and below or to the sides of the circles.",
      "Mix the icing sugar and egg white to make a thick but flowing icing. Split it roughly between five pots \u2013 leave one white, then colour the others. Flood each shape with a different colour, then add some coloured balls and leave to set. A pair of craft tweezers will help if you want the balls to be in a design rather than just scattered over.",
      "Add a dab of black colouring to the remaining white icing to make it grey, and add a little more icing sugar to thicken it. Spoon into the piping bag, snip off the end, then pipe on the strings, bows and stars or snowflakes. Tie the ribbon around the base of the cake and leave to dry."

      "Start with the fruit. Pour the apple juice into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the butter, let it melt, then take off the heat and add the syrup and rum. Put the mixed fruit and cranberries into a large bowl, pour over the hot rum mix, then cover tightly with cling film and leave overnight.",
      "The next day, heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and double-line a 20cm round, deep cake tin with non-stick baking parchment. Beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and pale, then gradually beat in the eggs until light and fluffy. If the mix starts to split or look lumpy, add 1 tbsp of the flour and keep beating. Sift in the flour, spices and 1/4 tsp salt, and fold in using a large spoon. Fold in the orange zest, nuts, soaked fruit and soaking liquid.",
      "Spoon the batter into the tin, level the top, then make a slight dimple in the middle using the back of the spoon. Bake for 1 hr 30 mins, then reduce oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1 and bake for a further 1 hr 45 mins or until it has risen, is a dark golden colour and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Put the tin on a cooling rack and leave until warm.",
      "To feed the cake the first time, use a cocktail stick to poke all over the top of the warm cake. Stir together the rum and maple syrup, then slowly spoon over the cake. Cool completely, then remove the baking parchment, wrap loosely in clean baking parchment and store in an airtight tin. Feed the cake every week to 10 days until you decorate it.",
      "Now you're ready to cover and ice your cake. Sit the cake on a large flat plate or board and brush a thin layer of apricot jam over the top and sides.",
      "Dust the work surface with icing sugar. Lightly knead the marzipan until pliable, then roll out in one direction, turning the marzipan 90 degrees every few rolls and keeping the pressure even. Keep it in a circular shape, reshaping it if needed as you go. When large enough (about 35cm across for a 20cm cake), lift over the cake. Smooth the top and sides with your palms and trim with a knife. If you have time, leave to dry overnight.",
      "Clean the work surface and rolling pin. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the sides with cooled boiled water or alcohol, then cover with the sugarpaste icing, rolling it in the same way. Lift onto the cake, then work your way gradually around, smoothing out any folds with your palms to avoid wrinkles forming. Polish the icing with the palms of your hands (or a proper cake smoother) for a smooth finish. Trim with a sharp knife.",
      "Now you're ready to decorate. Make the icing by mixing the egg white and sugar together until thick and smooth. Using a palette knife, spread a thin layer of icing all around the sides of the iced cake. Sit the cake on a large tray and, holding it at an angle, scatter on the sprinkles. You can use a palette knife to help, scooping them up and pressing them on. Leave to dry, then set aside.",
      "Sit the cake topper on the jar\u2019s lid, then invert the jar over it. If the figurine looks a little lost in the jar once closed, then glue in the milk bottle top as a booster. When you\u2019re happy, glue the cake topper in place and leave to dry.",
      "Use the acrylic paint to paint some simple fir trees on the back of the jar (remember to have it upside down as you paint) and leave to dry.",
      "When ready, fill the jar three-quarters full with water, add the glycerine and dissolve. Spoon in the glitter, then screw on the lid and shake well. The glitter will clump a bit at first but then separate. Carefully top up with water if needed, then screw tightly and dry any drips, taking care not to damage your painted trees. Glue the ribbon onto the lid/base of your snow globe.",
      "Use a little of the leftover icing to attach the jelly beans to the top of the cake, leaving room for the snow globe. Sit the snow globe on top (you can press it into the icing a little if it seems wobbly) and shake whenever you feel like it!"

Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds and add to the cream with the pod. Heat until steaming but not boiling, then pour the hot liquid onto the yolks, whisking as you go. Strain the liquid through a sieve into a clean saucepan and discard the vanilla pod. Return to a low-medium heat and whisk for about 10 mins until very thick. If you get lumps, simply whisk them out. Pour the custard into a jug and cover with cling film directly on the surface. Chill for 11 /2 hrs.",
      "Arrange half the profiteroles in the base of a 2-litre trifle bowl. Spoon 2 tbsp of the remaining alcohol over the profiteroles along with the orange juice, then crumble over the biscuits. Trickle the custard over the profiterole base. Arrange the remaining profiteroles on top of the custard, working around the edges first, then filling the centre. Arrange the clementine slices around the edge of the bowl, tucking them around the profiteroles",
      "Whisk the remaining alcohol, 500ml cream, 50g sugar and the orange zest until holding soft peaks. Spread the mixture over the profiteroles, right to the edge of the bowl, then return to the fridge until you\u2019re ready to serve. ",
      "For the meringue, put the egg whites, the remaining 175g sugar, 1 tbsp water and a good pinch of salt in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Whisk until thick and leaving a prominent trail from the beaters \u2013 this will take about 4 mins. Take the bowl off the heat and continue whisking for another 3 mins until cooled slightly and very stiff.",
      "Spoon the meringue onto the trifle, creating peaks and troughs with the back of a spoon. Use a blowtorch to scorch the meringue if you have one (but don\u2019t hold it too close to the bowl if it\u2019s made of delicate glass!). Best served straight away, but will keep for a day in the fridge."

Warm through over a low heat, just to melt \u2013 be careful not to overheat.",

Beat the eggs, then stir in the soured cream. Pour this and the melted chocolate over the flour mixture, then stir everything together \u2013 the mix will be very soft. Pour it into the tin, then bake for about 1\u00bd hrs, or until firm on top. Let the cake cool in the tin (it may crack if you turn it out too soon), then loosen the sides and carefully turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",

(Make a few extra in case of breakages and wipe the cutter each time you press a star shape.) When completely set, cut through the star outlines with a small sharp knife, then carefully lift them off onto baking parchment.",

Remove from the heat, tip in the chocolate and swirl so it starts to melt, then pour in the boiling water and stir to melt completely. Pour into a small bowl and chill in the fridge for about 1 hr to cool and thicken slightly. Beat with an electric hand mixer until thick and glossy.",
      "When the cake is completely cold, place it into the fridge to chill (this makes it easier to slice). Take the cake out of the fridge and turn it over so the flat base becomes the top of the cake. Slice the cake horizontally into three. Sandwich back together with the white chocolate icing, not quite up to the edges. (This can be done a day ahead and chilled.)",

Put the cake on a wire rack with parchment paper underneath (to catch any drips). Pour and spread the icing all over the cake. Leave to set slightly, then arrange the truffles down the centre and prop 5 or 6 of your best stars against them."

Meanwhile, beat the egg whites until stiff then, while still beating, gradually pour in the hot sugar syrup in a steady stream. Keep beating until the mixture is fluffy and thick enough to spread \u2013 this might take a few mins as the mixture cools. Beat in the icing sugar.",
      "Spread two of the sponges with jam and some of the icing mixture, then sandwich the cakes together with the plain one on top. Use a little of the frosting to ice the whole cake (don\u2019t worry about crumbs at this stage). Use the remaining icing to ice the cake again, smoothing the side, and swirling it on top. Crush four of the candy canes and sprinkle over the cake, then add the remaining whole candy canes, meringues and sweets."

Stamp a hole in the top of the ring using a small cutter, or the end of a piping nozzle, as soon as it comes out the oven \u2013 you can tie a pretty ribbon through this later. Leave to cool on the trays, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Mix the icing sugar with enough water to make a thick icing. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a small nozzle, then decorate the biscuits as you wish, using a little edible glitter, if you like. We flooded some of the biscuits with pale blue icing (see tip) and piped white details on the others. Leave the icing to dry for 1-2 hrs, then use a little more icing to stick the biscuits to the wreath. Thread a ribbon through the hole and wrap up in cellophane, if giving as a gift (the ribbon is just for show and may not support a hung wreath). Will keep for 2 weeks."

I'm not sure whether the rolling is actually needed because I baked it twice and on both occasions the swiss roll broke. The first time, I left it overnight and as it cooled it stuck to the parchment paper. Second attempt, I unrolled it while warm and it was more flexible this way. Maybe next time, I will not bother rolling at all and sprinkle some much needed Malibu over the sponge to keep it moist and hopefully flexible.",

Don\u2019t overdo it as the paste can get greasy. Add a bit more icing sugar if it seems too wet. Shape into a ball, then wrap and keep in a cool place until ready to cover the cake. Can be made up to 2 days in advance.",
      "Lift the cake onto a cake board or plate, then use a pastry brush to cover evenly with a thin layer of jam. Dust the work surface with more icing sugar, then roll the marzipan into a circle about 40cm across, dusting underneath the marzipan with more icing sugar and turning it a quarter turn after every few pushes of the rolling pin.",
      "Flip the top of the circle back over your rolling pin so you can see the underside of the marzipan, then lift the pin up and lift the marzipan over the cake. Stop once you can see that the edge of the marzipan nearest you is about level with the bottom of the cake. Flop the front of the marzipan down. Smooth the paste over the cake using the palms of your hands, then trim with a sharp knife. If any cracks appear, simply pinch the paste back together and smooth. Leave to dry for at least 24 hrs, or up to 3 days, before covering with icing.",
      " Although homemade marzipan contains raw eggs, the amount of sugar, and lack of moisture, prevents bacteria growing when left at room temperature, so your cake should last for 1-2 months iced. The most important thing is that you don't scrimp on drying time \u2013 once you\u2019ve covered your cake in marzipan it should be left to completely dry out, before you then cover it with icing. If you want to make marzipan before you are ready to cover your cake, then wrap it well in cling film and keep in a fridge for up to a week \u2013 as wrapped in a ball it will still contain a little moisture. As it contains raw eggs it shouldn\u2019t be given to anyone in an at-risk group, including pregnant women, the elderly, the unwell and the very young. You can make a cooked marzipan, which carries no risks. It is a little softer, and harder to work with, but a good substitute if you are at all worried."

Spread this over three of the gingerbread trees and leave to dry. Spoon another third of the icing into a piping bag fitted with a fine writing nozzle. Pipe rough fir-tree-like branches over the remaining trees. Once the green iced trees have dried to the touch, pipe branches over those, too.",
      "When the icing has set, fix the trees onto the cake and around the edge using spots of the remaining thick royal icing. Put the smaller snowballs around and on top of the cake. Pipe eyes and a mouth onto the head of the snowman and insert the nose. Fix the snowman\u2019s head on with a spot more icing, position him on the cake, then carefully tie a ribbon scarf with the shorter length of ribbon. This is easiest if you start with too much ribbon, tie it, then trim with scissors. To finish, attach ribbon around the base and secure woth a double-sided tape."

For the sauce melt the butter, sugar and cream together, then turn up the heat until it bubbles and comes together into a smooth, shiny sauce. Stir in the rum and raisins and cool. Turn out the puddings from the moulds, scraping around the sides of each with a blunt cutlery knife first. Line up in a shallow baking dish and cover with cling film. Keep the puds and sauce somewhere cool for up to 24 hrs.",
      "To serve spoon a little sauce and raisins over each pud, then pour the rest around (if the sauce has separated a little just gently reheat and stir back together). Cover the whole dish with a tent of foil. When the Christmas dinner is ready turn the oven down to 120C/100C fan/gas \u00bc and reheat puddings for about 30-40 mins until hot.

It should be long enough to go round the cake \u2013 use a piece of kitchen string to help you measure it. Use a rolling pin to roll the sausage into a strip about 5cm wide. Use a small, sharp knife to straighten one edge, and trim the other into a wiggly edge.",

Brush the strip, circles and the very bottom edge of the cake with a little runny icing made with 100g sifted icing sugar and a splash of water. Scatter the desiccated coconut over the strip and circles, gently pressing to stick and cover. Starting with one end of the strip, stick it round the base of the cake. This can be a bit fiddly, so if you\u2019re nervous, simply halve the icing from the start and do in 2 half-length strips, using a little more coconut to hide the joins on the cake.",
      "SHAPE THE SNOWMEN: Roll the remaining third of regal icing into 2 large balls, 2 medium balls and 2 small balls. Stick together, squashing slightly, into 2 snowmen. Brush 4 cocktail sticks with a little brown food colouring and stick into the snowmen for arms.",

Use another clove to make little holes where the noses will go, dab a bit of runny icing into the holes and stick on the noses, pushing them into the holes to help hold them.",
      "SMILEY FACES: Use a black or brown writing icing pen to dot on smiley mouths and eyes \u2013 I find it helps to mark tiny holes with the end of a cocktail stick first. It stops you making mistakes and helps the icing stay in place.",
      "MAKE THE HAT: Dye another lump of regal icing trimmings with food colouring (we used green). Shape most into a woolly hat shape, pressing a slight dip into the bottom with your thumb where it will sit on the snowman\u2019s head. Roll a little ball to stick on top of the hat; attach it with more runny icing. Then roll and cut a thin strip to stick round the base of the hat. Use a cocktail stick to make markings like a woolly hat and rough up the ball on top. A little more runny icing will help it stick onto your snowman\u2019s head.",
      "AND LASTLY, THE SCARF: Knot the strawberry laces together at one end. Tightly plait a 10cm length and knot at the end again. Using scissors, snip the ends, leaving about 1cm for tassels after the knot, then wrap around the neck of the other snowman. Sit the wobbly snowy islands on top of the cake and a snowman on each one."
